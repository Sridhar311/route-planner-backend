🚀 Project Description
    The Route Planner is a web application that allows users to find the shortest path between two locations. 
    It uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to calculate the shortest route and provides the distance in kilometers. 
    The backend is built with Node.js and deployed on Render, while the frontend is hosted on GitHub Pages.
    
🛠️ Features
    Dynamic Pathfinding: Calculates the shortest path between two points.
    Interactive Map: Visual representation of the route on a map.
    Real-Time Markers: Start and goal markers can be dragged to dynamically update the path.
    User-Friendly: Easy-to-use interface for entering start and goal locations.
